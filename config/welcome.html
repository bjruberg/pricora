<h1>Welcome to Pricora!</h1>
<div class="container max-w-3xl">
  <p class="mt-2">
    Pricora is an OpenSource system for digitally managing contact lists for gatherings, meetings and public places. It
    uses a strong encryption system to save all gathered information on disk.
  </p>

  <p>Pricora users must treat their passwords VERY careful because contact data cannot be restored without them!</p>

  <p class="mt-2">Here you can:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-outside mt-1 bg-gray-200 p-4 pl-8">
    <li>Create and manage meetings (user account required)</li>
    <li>Share links as text or QR code with people to add their contact information (user accout required)</li>
    <li>Add contact information to a meeting without (user account or share link required)</li>
    <li>Manage user accounts (admin account required)</li>
    <li>Export contact data as CSV files for your events only (user account required)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Why using Pricora?</h2>

    <li>Data of attendants can be automatically deleted</li>
